# prac-copyfile
First practice in C. A simple command line utility which replicates the copy function of many, many shells. Works on Windows and POSIX-compatible systems.

## On TODO list after this project:
- Continue C practice with more projects.
- Get better at GitHub (seriously, this was a pain).
- Get familiarized with standardized makefiles (& configure), and maybe cmake.
- Learn about GitHub workflows.
